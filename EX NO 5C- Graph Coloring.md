## AIM:

To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Problem Description:
In a hilly region, several radio towers are installed to provide communication services. However, due to signal interference, two adjacent towers (i.e., in communication range of each other) must not use the same frequency channel.

You are given N radio towers and their communication ranges represented as an undirected graph. Your task is to assign channels (colors) to these towers using at most M channels such that no two adjacent towers use the same channel.

Write a program to determine if such an assignment is possible or not.

Input Format:
First line contains two integers: N (number of towers), and M (number of available frequency channels).

Next line contains an integer E — number of edges representing the communication range.

Next E lines contain two integers u and v — representing that tower u and tower v are within range (0-based index).

Output Format:
Print "YES" if it's possible to assign frequencies to towers such that no two adjacent towers have the same frequency.

Otherwise, print "NO".

## Algorithm:

1. Read inputs: number of towers **N**, number of channels **M**, and number of edges **E**.
2. Build an adjacency list to represent the undirected graph of tower communication range.
3. Maintain a `color[]` array of size `N` initialized to 0 (uncolored).
4. Use a **recursive backtracking function**:

   * For each tower, try assigning a channel `1` to `M`.
   * Before assigning, check using `isSafe()` that no adjacent tower has the same color.
5. If assigning a color leads to a valid configuration for all towers → return **true**.
6. If no color can be assigned for a tower → backtrack and try another color.
7. If no assignment is possible → print **"NO"**, otherwise **"YES"**.
