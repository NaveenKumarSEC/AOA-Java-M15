# EX 5D Flower Planting.
## DATE:22-03-2026

## AIM:

To write a Java program to for given constraints.
You are given n gardens, labelled from 1 to n.

You also have a list called paths, where each element paths[i] = [xi, yi] represents a bidirectional road connectingthe  garden xi and garden yi.

You want to plant one flower in each garden, and there are exactly 4 types of flowers labelled as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Your goal is to plant flowers such that:

No two connected gardens (i.e., connected via a path) have the same flower type.

Return any valid flower assignment as an array where:

answer[i] is the flower type planted in the (i+1) ᵗʰ garden

It is guaranteed that:

No garden is connected to more than 3 other gardens

A valid flower assignment always exists

## Algorithm:

1. Read the number of gardens **n** and number of paths **m**.
2. Build an adjacency list to represent the bidirectional paths between gardens.
3. Create an array `res[]` of size `n` to store the assigned flower types.
4. For each garden:

   * Check all its neighbours and mark the flower types used by those neighbours.
   * Assign the **smallest flower type (1 to 4)** that is not used by its neighbours.
5. Print the resulting flower assignment.
6. Since each garden has at most 3 neighbours, at least one of the four flower types will always be available.
