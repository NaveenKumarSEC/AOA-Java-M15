# EX 5B Topological Sort - Khan's Algorithm
## DATE:21-03-2026

## AIM:

To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Problem Description:
A software development team is preparing for a product release. The release consists of multiple tasks, each dependent on other tasks being completed first. You are to determine a valid order in which all tasks can be completed. If it's not possible due to cyclic dependencies, output that the release cannot be scheduled.

Each task is labeled from 0 to n-1. The dependencies are provided in the form of pairs [a, b] which means task a depends on task b.

Implement a program to find a valid task execution order using topological sort.

Input Format:

An integer n — number of tasks.

An integer m — number of dependencies.

m lines follow with two integers a and b — representing a depends on b.

Output Format:

If a valid order exists, print the task numbers in a possible execution order (space-separated).

If not, print "Release cannot be scheduled".

## Algorithm:

1. Read the number of tasks `n` and dependencies `m`.
2. Create an adjacency list for the directed graph.
3. Create an indegree array to count incoming edges for each task.
4. For each dependency pair `[a, b]`, add edge `b → a` and increase indegree of `a`.
5. Add all tasks with indegree **0** into a queue (tasks with no dependencies).
6. While queue is not empty:

   * Remove a task from the queue → add it to the result list
   * Reduce indegree of its adjacent tasks
   * If any task's indegree becomes 0, add it to the queue
7. If the result list contains all tasks → valid schedule
8. Otherwise, a cycle exists → print **"Release cannot be scheduled"**
